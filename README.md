# Matplotlib-challenge
This project utilizes the use of the library Matplotlib to be able to represent data through a more versatile tool. Being able to represent Data in several different formats 

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
using and utilizing Juypter Notebook <br />
accessing multiple csv files and exctracting data <br />
data manipulation techniques to be able to represent several different statistical points in the data <br />
be able to represent data and trends through Matplotlib and being able to pull format the graphical data<br />
finding meaningful conclusions from the given data<br />
<br />

  **First opinon of settuping up the code:**
  
  This project is showing the culmination of the technqiues i picked up within the first several weeks of the course by being able to disect very large data sets and being able to graph them in a meaningful way to be able to present it. This required a lot of extra thought to be able to organize and set up the code, but overall this project will be a good back bone to my future coding endeavors.
