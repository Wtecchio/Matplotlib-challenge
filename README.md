# Matplotlib-challenge
This project utilizes the use of the library Matplotlib to be able to represent data through a more versatile tool. Being able to represent Data in several different formats 

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
using and utilizing Juypter Notebook <br />
accessing multiple csv files and exctracting data <br />
data manipulation techniques to be able to represent several different statistical points in the data <br />
be able to represent data and trends through Matplotlib and being able to pull format the graphical data<br />
finding meaningful conclusions from the given data<br />
<br />

  **First opinon of settuping up the code:**
  
  This project is showing the culmination of the technqiues i picked up within the first several weeks of the course by being able to disect very large data sets and being able to graph them in a meaningful way to be able to present it. This required a lot of extra thought to be able to organize and set up the code, but overall this project will be a good back bone to my future coding endeavors. 
  
Observations and Insights
Some observations seen:
First looking at the bar-graph data. glaring conclusions can be found with the median size of the tumors vs the treatment. Capomulin with and average of 40.675741mm3 vs the placebo/constant of 54.033581mm3

This shows great results with the Capomulin Drug Regimen to being able to effectively treat the tumor. Another noteable drug with very similar results to Capomulin was Ramicane with 40.216745mm3

Other small observations that was able to be seen was the comparison of male subjects vs females subjects. in the population size, male subjects were more common than female ones, coming at a 51% majority.

It is also possible to see a positive increasing correlation between a mouse's weight and the tumor size it is carrying, this makes sense considering the larger the subject, the larger the turmor is on the subject as well.

The data was also cleaned of duplicates and unclear solutions, such as outliers
